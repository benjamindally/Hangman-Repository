Hangman Game

What this Project Does:
This project is a hangman game where the user has to try to guess a word that has been randomly generated by the browser. This game is James Bond themed and all the words to be guessed are somehow realated to James Bond. 

As users enter a letter, the game will output whether it is correct or not. If it appears in the "Mission" box, then it is a successful guess. If it appears in the "Shots Taken" section, then it is an unsuccessful guess. 

After a letter is pressed, the game will display how many guesses remain in the word in the "Missing Letters" section. Below this, the game displays how many guesses remain before the user loses.

Why is the Project Useful:
This project is useful for two reasons. First, it is a fun game for any James Bond enthusiast. Second, it showcases my emerging skills as a web developer.

How Can Users Get Started:
Feel free to add on to the game and include more words in the game.
